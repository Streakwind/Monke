# Bot Setup <h> <h/>
Please don't run an instance of my bot. <br> </br>
If you do want to run an instance of my bot, please edit the code by yourself, and don't ask me what to edit.<br> </br>
The only file that you need to add is `config.py`<br> </br>
To setup `config.py`, have 3 webhooks and one token ready. You do not need all three webhooks, and you can 
edit the code to make it only require 2 webhooks, or even one. `config.py` should look something like this

```py
token = "(token here)"
webhook = "(status webhook url here)"
logging_webhook = "(logging webhook url here)"
logging_webhook2 = "(direct message webhook url here)"
```
<br> </br>

`config.py` should be in the bot's folder.
